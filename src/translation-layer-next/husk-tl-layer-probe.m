/*
 * What the screen is made of, asked of the layer this engine renders into.
 *
 * A frame can be drawn, uploaded, swapped, and still never be seen: Core Animation shows nothing for a layer
 * that is not in a window, that is hidden, that sits outside its parent, or whose drawable does not match the
 * surface, and it reports none of it -- the frame counter looks healthy while the screen is black. These
 * answers are the difference between a picture that never arrived and one that arrived into something nobody
 * can see.
 *
 * The second line is the chain of layers above this one, because a layer of the right size can still be parked
 * outside a parent of the wrong one, and nothing about the layer itself says so. It ends at the window, which
 * is the only thing that says whether any of it is being shown at all.
